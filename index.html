          <h2>Hello! My name is Alexs</h2>
          <p>
            I am currently a full-time high school student, I take a small portion of my day to dwell into the world that is computer science and engineering. I am in love with cybersecurity, systems programming, mechatronics, as well as full stack web development. My favorite languages are Java, Html, C, and also swift.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although I haven't been coding and building for a very long time, it has been a life-long passion. I'm also a Linux enthusiast, though i use MacOs on a daily, Linux has never once left the dome that I call my brain. I often build robots just to test my codes and to test beyond the limit of my skill and  I also have a keen interest in cyber security. The combination of these two aspect is the key that will develop the world toward a brighter future. In I wish to spread the skills that i have to other people because of the struggle that i had obtaining them, and to attend MIT or NYU to study Computer engineering and/or Cyber security. As a life-long learner and always ready to learn new skills, I will never turn my back on developing ground-breaking technologies.

            <h1>Tech System support</h1>
            <p>
              I am a part of the tech system support in our school, this program is a channel in which i utilize to help the community. This program has allowed me along with others to host Lewhacks() in which allow us to bring in about 100 participants to form a community in which is passionate about computer. Tech system support has also allowed me to build on my social and technical support since i am connecting my skills toward the community, Such as talking about what they should do about the flaws of their computers, troubleshooting and also fixing network issues.

            <h1>Robotics Captain</h1>
            <p>
              Being in the robotics team doesn't just help me grow as a computer scientist, it also develop my sense of leadership. I was once just a member, however i wanted to make a greater change on the team therefore i became one of the captain. During the 2016-2017 season, we were able to achieve a lot, We were able to qualify for the NYC regional with a team full of rookies. We created a shooter mechanism using a 2-chain system and eco-friendly material. Our handwork had resulted in an incredibly speedy robot that has much potential.

            <p>
              Throughout my middle school and high school period, My parents has pushed me into going to church every Sunday. Then an idea came to mind that i should help since i have some sort of skills that would be beneficial to the community. Alongside a crew, i helped set up the whole sounds system for the whole church; I’ve moved into multiple churches therefore I’ve set up sound systems and wiring for multiple churches. I’ve also assisted in the directing of the mixer board and also conducting technical diagnostic.

          <p>
            MeastroAuto is a robot that I’ve made during one of the FTC season of 2016-2017.
             Ive realized that regular Java programming language is the one that is used for robotics.
             However, i wasn't experience within he language therefore I've made the robot.
             Ive build it to assimilate to the standards in which is stated within thee robotics manual. I’ve used it in order to program a tele op and also the autonomous code, in which is needed during the season.

            Usb switchblade is a project I started in middle school, it is a cyber security project in which meant to act as a keyboard.
            When it is plugged into a computer, it utilizes the computer trust in the keyboard to run codes within the computer. I’ve obtained the idea from online, however i attempted to write the codes and configuration on my own.
            It is also a part of a open source project.
