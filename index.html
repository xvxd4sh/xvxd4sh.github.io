      <p class="allign" >I’m Alexs Wijoyo, a robotics, computer, and cyber security enthusiast.
        I am currently attending <a href="http://www.francislewishs.org" content=""> Francis Lewis High School </a>, majoring in both Engineering and Robotics.
        The field of technology has always interested me for it is such a vast topic in todays world, growing
        up I’ve realized that there are a lot potential embedded within many devices and it is our responsibility
        to improve them to better our living conditions. Within the school there are 8 <a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/ftc">FTC</a> teams and one <a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc">FRC</a> team, in which
        I am apart of both. In the 2016-2017 season, I was the captain for the Francis lewis high school’s FTC team <a href="https://flhsrobotics.wixsite.com/home/4784">4784</a>,
       Tetricons. I am also a part of the Tech Support system team at Francis lewis High school where we help teachers
        with technical issues. If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact me.  </p>

        Ever since I step foot in America, i didn't know of the education system and any other things. I started middle school with little to no english, however, somehow I develop a passion for computers. I volunteered at the school library throughout middle school and i spent the time helping and also learning through books and online courses. When I enter high School, I was admitted into one of the best program in one of the worst school, however I took this opportunity to be the best I can be and worked with what I have to improve myself. I worked with the IT, assistant Principal and also many of the STEM teachers to improve my skills in engineering, robotics and also Computer science. Then, I transfer to a better school where i was greeted with respect. In Francis Lewis High School, I join JROTC and also the robotics team in order to learn hands on regarding leadership and also the skills I need to prepare myself for the field that I will be working with. I also plan to obtain an education in the field of computer engineering and cyber security for this will be the stepping stone toward a better future, for me and also the world.
